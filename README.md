# BookStack Devops

This repo contains scripts & configuration used for
installation & project maintenance of [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/).

For installation scripts, we focus on supporting Ubuntu LTS releases only to keep maintenance feasible.

Please don't offer alternative systems or methods of hosting (Such as docker, VMs etc...).
The scope of official support is kept narrow to ensure we can continue to offer some level of support to users
using these scripts and configurations.
