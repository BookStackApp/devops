# This example nginx config file shows a method of hosting BookStack on a 
# URL sub path (http://example.com/bookstack). There are many ways to achieve
# this but the below method uses a reverse proxy style method to keep the BookStack
# configuration contained within it's own server block.

# There are two server blocks in this file.
# The first is pointed at BookStack so has the PHP config, but
# this is only intended to be used locally (hence on port 8080 and using "localhost").
# The "root" directory is pointed to the "public" folder within your BookStack 
# install folder.

# The second would represent your existing website (http://example.com in this case).
# The "location /bookstack/" block will take web requests to `/bookstack/` and proxy 
# them to the first internal-only server block. 

# Note: The "root" of the first server block should not be a child directory of the 
#       second server block. This would likely cause an insecure setup.

  listen 8080;
  listen [::]:8080;

  }
}

    proxy_redirect off;
  }
